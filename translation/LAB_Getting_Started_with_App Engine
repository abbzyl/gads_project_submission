#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives 

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Initialize App Engine.
- Preview an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
- Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
- Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

## Steps:

1.  Initialize the App Engine by running this command:

   *gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID*

2.  Clone the repository using the git command:

   *git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples*

   - Navigate into the source directory of the sample app:

     *cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world*

3.  In the Cloud Shell command prompt update and download the package list by executing the following command:

   *sudo apt-get update*

   - set up a virtual environment and run the application

   *sudo apt-get install virtualenv -y* 

   *virtualenv -p python3 venv*

   - activate the virtual environment

   *source venv/bin/activate*

   - Go to your project directory and install dependencies:

   *pip install  -r requirements.txt*

   - run the application with the command:

   *python main.py*

4. In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application

   - the result will show a webpage with "Hello World" displayed.

   - To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.
   - verify the app is not deployed from the app engine dashboard.

5. Now that we are sure the app is running locally, let us deploy to a engine. To deploy our application to the App Engine standard enviroment, execute this command:

*cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world*

6. Deploy the Hello World application by executing this command:

*gcloud app deploy*

- This app deploy command using the *app.yaml* file to identify project configuration.

7.  Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com by running this command:

*gcloud app browse*

8. App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed. 

   - However, you can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.

   In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click App Engine >  Settings. 

   - Click Disable application
   - Read the dialog message. Enter the **App ID** and click **DISABLE**.
   - If you refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.
